abstract: Improving the resolution of magnetic resonance (MR) image data is
  critical to computer-aided diagnosis and brain function analysis. Higher
  resolution helps to capture more detailed content, but typically induces to
  lower signal-to-noise ratio and longer scanning time. To this end, MR image
  super-resolution has become a widely-interested topic in recent times.
  Existing works establish extensive deep models with the conventional
  architectures based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this work, to
  further advance this research field, we make an early effort to build a
  Transformer-based MR image super-resolution framework, with careful designs on
  exploring valuable domain prior knowledge. Specifically, we consider two-fold
  domain priors including the high-frequency structure prior and the
  inter-modality context prior, and establish a novel Transformer architecture,
  called Cross-modality high-frequency Transformer (Cohf-T), to introduce such
  priors into super-resolving the low-resolution (LR) MR images. Comprehensive
  experiments on two datasets indicate that Cohf-T achieves new state-of-the-art
  performance.
