abstract: Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims at learning to localize objects of interest by only using the image-level labels as the supervision. While numerous efforts have been made in this field, recent approaches still suffer from two challenges one is the part domination issue while the other is the learning robustness issue. Specifically, the former makes the localizer prone to the local discriminative object regions rather than the desired whole object, and the latter makes the localizer over-sensitive to the variations of the input images so that one can hardly obtain localization results robust to the arbitrary visual stimulus. To solve these issues, we propose a novel framework to strengthen the learning tolerance, referred to as SLT-Net, for WSOL. Specifically, we consider two-fold learning tolerance strengthening mechanisms. One is the semantic tolerance strengthening mechanism, which allows the localizer to make mistakes for classifying similar semantics so that it will not concentrate too much on the discriminative local regions. The other is the visual stimuli tolerance strengthening mechanism, which enforces the localizer to be robust to different image transformations so that the prediction quality will not be sensitive to each specific input image. Finally, we implement comprehensive experimental comparisons on two widely-used datasets CUB and ILSVRC2012, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
