Hey! I am an associate professor at School of Computer Science, Beijing Technology and Business Unversity. I am mainly interested in effective medical artifical intelligence algorithms, Currently, I am working on larges-scale pretrained framework, light-weighted neural network, and multi-modal learning.

Before that, I got my Ph.D. from Beijing Institue of Technology (BIT), at fall 2017. Since Sep. 2015, I am a visiting PHD student at Human Sensing Lab in Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I am really fortunate to work with my advisor Dong Huang and Prof. Fernando de la Torre . After my graduation, I joint Tencent, and highly focus on Computational Advertising, especially on lift-time value prediction and dvertising recommendation system.
